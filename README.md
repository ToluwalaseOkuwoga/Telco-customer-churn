### Overview

This is the analysis of a telecommunications companyâ€™s customer data for a quarter. It explores relevant categories, including customer demography, account details, and services used. Variables in these categories are analysed to understand the proportions that make up the customer population.

Churn rates across variables are also analysed to highlight the differences in churn means. This analysis is crucial in determining which factors affect churn more and could be used for feature engineering during predictive analytics. To this effect, I ran hypothesis tests on the variables and documented my findings.
